Paragraph 67-69:
"67. A growing economy creates more well-paying jobs. But the jobs
of the future will not be the same as the jobs of today. Rapid
technological advances, especially in Al, will transform workplaces
and jobs.
68. Just a few years ago, tools like ChatGPT didn't even exist. Now
there is a rapidly expanding ecosystem of Al models. They can
generate high-quality text, images, and videos. They can write better
programming code than many experts, assist in complex problem-
solving, and even help to accelerate research breakthroughs.
69. Al will get better in the future, and other new disruptive
technologies will emerge. It is hard to predict how they will impact
specific industries and jobs. But one thing is clear: our workers must
be equipped with the skills to stay competitive and relevant. That's
why we are investing heavily in lifelong learning, and have made
significant moves to strengthen SkillsFuture as a key pillar of our
social compact."

Paragraph 70-72:
"70. At last year's Budget, I introduced the SkillsFuture Level-Up
Programme, to support mid-career Singaporeans in getting a
significant skills reboot.
a. Under the programme, all Singaporeans aged 40 years and
above will get $4,000 in SkillsFuture Credit.
b. From next month, individuals can apply for a training
allowance of up to $3,000 per month for selected full-time
courses. They will have 24 months' worth of allowance,
which is up to $72,000 per worker.
71. Some Singaporeans prefer to continue working, while upskilling
on a part-time basis.
a. Take for example, Ms Zarina Binti Abdul Rahman. She
started out as an intern in Randstad Sourceright, a global
recruitment agency, and is now an office administrator.
b. She wants to upgrade her skills in business operations, but is
unable to pursue full-time studies due to her work and family
commitments. So she is pursuing a part-time Diploma in
Business Practice at Nanyang Polytechnic.
72. While workers like Zarina continue to earn their salaries during
part-time training, they also incur training-related expenses.
a. We will therefore extend the training allowance to workers
undergoing part-time training.
b. They can enjoy a fixed allowance of $300 per month to
defray their learning expenses.
c. And this part-time training allowance will be implemented
early next year."

Paragraph 73-75:
"73. We will also give a further boost to our lower-wage workers,
who will benefit from early upskilling.
a. Today, our lower-wage workers can tap on the Workfare Skills
Support Scheme from the age of 30.
b. The scheme provides employers with absentee payroll
support when they sponsor workers for training. It also
provides workers with a training allowance when they go for
self-sponsored training.
74. Currently, the Workfare Skills Support Scheme is designed
primarily to support short courses that are completed over a few
days. But lower-wage workers stand to benefit more from longer-
form courses that provide more substantial reskilling and upskilling.
75. We will therefore introduce an enhanced tier of support under
the Workfare Skills Support for lower-wage workers. This enhanced
support will be modelled after the SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme,
and will benefit lower-wage workers when they turn 30. So this will
start earlier at age 30."

"81. In addition, we will introduce a redesigned SkillsFuture
Enterprise Credit.
a. The credit is an existing scheme which helps employers
defray the out-of-pocket costs for enterprise and workforce
transformation.
b. But to use the credit, companies have to pay upfront for staff
training, and then wait for reimbursement. And there are
also employers who are not aware of the credit or how it can
be used.
82. So we will redesign the credit to make it more accessible.
a. The revamped credit will operate more like an online wallet.
b. Companies can easily check how much they have. And they
can use the credits to immediately offset out-of-pocket costs
for eligible workforce transformation initiatives and courses,

fresh $10,000 in the redesigned SkillsFuture Enterprise credit. The
